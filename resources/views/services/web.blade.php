            However, some companies now extend their web development services to UI/ UX design, testing and maintenance, while any design tasks literally belong to web design, but not web development. Despite some confusion between such two terms, many of the mentioned tasks are often included in web service package when you outsource your software products.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 text-center">
            Moreover, any attractive websites now need to be optimized with search engines, provide good content and intuitive UI/UX design, or run seamlessly. Meanwhile, your idea is sometimes too complicated to turn into a real product. So to facilitate communication between stakeholders and web engineers, many firms now provide business consulting services. For example, Boldare often helps validate the business ideas of clients, set goals or identify possible challenges related to software creation; or Designveloper will give in-depth consultancy of business solutions or technical analysis to your business hypothesis. If you are still struggling with digitalizing ideas, any expert advice is more advisable.
